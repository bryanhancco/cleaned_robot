# Packages referenced in the repository but NOT found in the current virtualenv.
# I include recommended/latest compatible ranges — install or pin to your preferred version.
# These were not detected under EntornoVirtual/Lib/site-packages at the time of scanning.
tensorflow>=2.13.0
matplotlib>=3.8.0
pyserial>=3.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# Added mediapipe as a pinned dependency (user requested). If you prefer a range, change to 'mediapipe>=0.10.0'
mediapipe==0.10.18
# NOTE: mediapipe is commented out because its numpy requirements conflict with
# some other pinned packages (opencv/pandas). If you need mediapipe, consider
# installing it separately in an isolated env or adjust numpy/opencv pins.

# Optional: if you prefer headless OpenCV (no GUI), replace opencv-python with opencv-python-headless
